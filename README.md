Hi, I’m Brittany, a junior business intelligence analyst with a background as a dietitian and small business owner. I have 4 years of experience analyzing my business data and leveraging those insights to drive growth, and in this time I have fallen in love with the analytics side of running a business! I am eager to blend my experiences and technical skills to become a successful business analyst for a company in the health and wellness industry.

Currently, I am continuing to see my personal nutrition clients while concurrently growing my data-specific experience via outsourced projects for other companies. I am also enrolled in a Business Intelligence Analyst bootcamp to further hone my technical skills. During this time, I have become very familiar with Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau and Power BI via both theory work and projects.
